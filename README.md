# Strength Classifier App
This is a machine learning project that classifies strength categories based on input data using a Random Forest Classifier. The app demonstrates the implementation of an ensemble learning method to achieve reliable and accurate classification performance.

# Project Overview
The Strength Classifier App takes feature inputs related to strength metrics and predicts the corresponding strength category. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation results to help understand the classifier's performance.
